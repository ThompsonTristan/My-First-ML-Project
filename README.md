# My-First-ML-Project
My first ML project is about predicting iris flowers from Iris Dataset from Kaggle

## Dataset Link
[Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)

## How to use
Because my notebook is based on Kaggle, here is the steps on how to use it:
- You can download my notebook
- Click the Iris Dataset link above
- Click 'Code' and make a new notebook
- Import the notebook you've downloaded
